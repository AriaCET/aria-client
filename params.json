Asterisk can be made to run as paging system,but this feature is not given much importance. The steps are very crude and the resulting system is painful for a user to use. \r\nWe are trying to streamline this process and is trying to provide a easy one-click aproach. It uses the Asterisk Telephony server at the back and uses SIP/RTP protocols for data transfer.\r\n\r\n###Setting up the system.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/abilng/aria_client.git\r\n$ cd src\r\n$ ./ariasetup.py #sets up the password, Registration details & Speaker details. Single time.\r\n$ ./main.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\npython 2\r\npython-pjsua\r\npythin-QtSide\r\n\r\nCreated for [College Of Engineering, Trivandrum (CET)](www.cet.ac.in), With financial assistance from [Centre for Engineering Research and Development(CERD)](www.cerd.cet.ac.in).","tagline":"Asterisk based Public Addressing System","google":""}
